## HPC Projects

Projects created for Dr. Scott's Spring 2024 Parallel Hardware and Distributed Systems (ECE 8275) course at the University of Missouri - Columbia as part of coursework for the MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

PA1 and PA2 emphasize the use of cuda programming to implement a median filter algorithm on an image.

PA3 emphasises the use of the CuPy library to accelerate a simple FDTD (finite difference time domain) algorithm on a GPU.

K8S emphasizes the use of Kubernetes to accelerate a deep learning pipeline involving preprocessing data, training mutliple deep learning models in parallel, and running evaluation.
